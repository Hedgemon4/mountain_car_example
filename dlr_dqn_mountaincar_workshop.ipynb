This breaks the temporal correlation between consecutive samples, making the training data more like the independent and identically distributed (IID) data that neural networks are designed for.\n",
        "2.  **Target Network**: This is a separate, frozen copy of our main Q-network. It is used to calculate the target Q-values for our loss function. By keeping its weights fixed for a period of time, it provides a stable target, preventing the network from chasing a moving target, which can lead to oscillations and divergence.\n",
        "3.  **ε‑greedy Exploration**: This is a simple yet effective strategy to balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (taking the best-known action). With probability ε, we take a random action; otherwise, we take the action with the highest Q-value according to our network. We typically start with a high ε and gradually decrease it as we learn more about the environment.\n",

        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a solid foundation, but the world of Deep RL is vast. Here are some ideas for how you could extend this project:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Algorithmic Improvements**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Double DQN**: A small tweak to the TD target calculation that helps reduce the overestimation bias of Q-values, often leading to better performance. It uses the main network to select the best action and the target network to evaluate it:\n",
        "\n",
        "    $$\n",
        "    Y_t = r + \\gamma Q_{\\theta^-}\\left(s', \\arg\\max_{a'} Q_{\\theta}(s', a')\\right)\n",
        "    $$\n",
        "  * **Dueling DQN**: A neural network architecture that separates the estimation of state values, $V(s)$, and action advantages, $A(s, a)$. This can lead to better policy evaluation in the presence of many similar-valued actions.\n",
        "  * **Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)**: Instead of sampling uniformly from the replay buffer, PER samples transitions based on their TD error. This allows the agent to focus more on the experiences it was most surprised by, leading to more efficient learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **New Environments**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Try a **continuous** version of the environment, *MountainCarContinuous-v0*. In this version, the actions are continuous values, not discrete. Algorithms like **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)** or **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** are designed for these types of action spaces.\n",
        "  * Scale up to a high-dimensional Atari game like **Breakout**. This will require using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process the pixel inputs instead of an MLP. You'll also likely need to use **frame stacking** (combining several consecutive frames into one state) to give the agent a sense of motion.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Experimentation and Tuning**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Hyperparameter Search**: The performance of RL agents is often very sensitive to hyperparameters. Experiment with different values for the learning rate, epsilon decay schedule, network size, target update frequency, and replay buffer capacity.\n",
        "  * **Better Tooling**: For more serious experimentation, log your metrics (returns, losses, etc.) to a dedicated tool like **TensorBoard** or **Weights & Biases**. These tools provide much richer visualization and experiment tracking capabilities.\n",
        "  * **Code Optimization**: For a small speed-up, you can try using `torch.compile` (available in PyTorch 2.x and later) to Just-In-Time (JIT) compile your model for faster execution."
